# PDF-Package-Searcher
A program to search for specific text in PDF's in a user-defined directory, and then quickly open PDF's that meet search criteria, and/or copy the PDF's name.

This tool was created for Design Verification work my team was performing. We would tediously examine hundreds of PDF's to verify if a specific requirement was met in the design. This tool aided in finding the relevant files within seconds instead of hours.
